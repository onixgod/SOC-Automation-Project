# SOC Automation Project (Wazuh, TheHive and Shuffle)
## **Project Overview**

This project explores the design, deployment, and automation of a Security Operations Centre (SOC) using open-source tools, **Wazuh** for SIEM, **TheHive** for case management, and **Shuffle** for orchestration and automation (SOAR). The goal is to simulate and streamline Tier 1 SOC analyst workflows in a cloud-based lab environment.

The project is modular, with each section dedicated to a specific component. Just so you know, future updates will be noted at the beginning of the relevant module to maintain accuracy and clarity.

The project was inspired and guided by _Steven (@MyDFIR on YouTube)_, whose free educational content has been instrumental in developing practical cybersecurity skills.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives:

-   **Establish a Functional SOC Environment**: Deploy and configure a complete SOC infrastructure using Wazuh (SIEM), Shuffle (SOAR), and TheHive (Case Management) on cloud-based virtual machines
-   **Implement Multi-Platform Integration**: Successfully integrate three distinct security platforms through APIs and custom configurations to create a unified security ecosystem
-   **Automate Incident Response Workflows**: Develop automated playbooks that can detect, analyse, and respond to security incidents with minimal manual intervention
-   **Demonstrate SOC Tier 1 Competencies**: Showcase proficiency in tools and processes essential for entry-level SOC analyst roles

### Secondary Objectives:

-   **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Gain hands-on experience with cloud service deployment and network security configuration using DigitalOcean
-   **Security Tool Orchestration**: Master the configuration and management of enterprise-grade security tools in a distributed environment
-   **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**: Create comprehensive documentation that can serve as a reference for similar implementations

## **Automation Workflow Overview**

To streamline SOC operations, I implemented an automated workflow in **Shuffle** to respond to alerts received from **Wazuh**. The automation integrates **VirusTotal**, **TheHive**, and Wazuhâ€™s response APIs to detect, enrich, and respond to malicious events in real-time.

### **Workflow Description**

1.  **Trigger: Wazuh Alert Webhook**
    -   The workflow is initiated by an incoming alert from Wazuh via a webhook to Shuffle.
2.  **Initial Processing**
    -   The alert is parsed and key indicators (e.g., IP address, user, rule ID) are extracted.
3.  **IP Reputation Check**
    -   The IP address involved in the alert is sent to **VirusTotal** for enrichment.
    -   If the IP is marked as malicious:
        -   The IP is added to a block list.
        -   An alert is generated in **TheHive** under the _Brute Force_ or _Out-of-Office Logon_ templates.
        -   A **Wazuh active response** is triggered to block the IP.
4.  **Rule-Based Branching**
    -   If the alert corresponds to a _Brute Force Attempt_, _Suspicious Logon_, or _Mimikatz Detection_:
        -   Specific case templates are triggered in **TheHive**.
        -   Supporting evidence is enriched via VirusTotal, where applicable.
        -   The malicious IP is blocked if it is not already.
5.  **TheHive Integration**
    -   For each matched condition, a case is created in **TheHive** with detailed observables, tags (e.g., TTPs), and linked artifacts.
    -   Helps track incidents and assist SOC analysts with structured investigation workflows.
6.  **Wazuh Active Responses**
    -   Automated blocking of suspicious IPs or accounts is handled through **custom Wazuh response scripts** triggered by Shuffle, based on enrichment results and rule logic.
