# SOC Automation Project (Wazuh, TheHive and Shuffle)
## **Project Overview**

This project explores the design, deployment, and automation of a Security Operations Centre (SOC) using open-source tools, **Wazuh** for SIEM, **TheHive** for case management, and **Shuffle** for orchestration and automation (SOAR). The goal is to simulate and streamline Tier 1 SOC analyst workflows in a cloud-based lab environment.

The project is modular, with each section dedicated to a specific component. Just so you know, future updates will be noted at the beginning of the relevant module to maintain accuracy and clarity.

The project was inspired and guided by _Steven (@MyDFIR on YouTube)_, whose free educational content has been instrumental in developing practical cybersecurity skills.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives:

-   **Establish a Functional SOC Environment**: Deploy and configure a complete SOC infrastructure using Wazuh (SIEM), Shuffle (SOAR), and TheHive (Case Management) on cloud-based virtual machines
-   **Implement Multi-Platform Integration**: Successfully integrate three distinct security platforms through APIs and custom configurations to create a unified security ecosystem
-   **Automate Incident Response Workflows**: Develop automated playbooks that can detect, analyse, and respond to security incidents with minimal manual intervention
-   **Demonstrate SOC Tier 1 Competencies**: Showcase proficiency in tools and processes essential for entry-level SOC analyst roles

### Secondary Objectives:

-   **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Gain hands-on experience with cloud service deployment and network security configuration using DigitalOcean
-   **Security Tool Orchestration**: Master the configuration and management of enterprise-grade security tools in a distributed environment
-   **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**: Create comprehensive documentation that can serve as a reference for similar implementations
